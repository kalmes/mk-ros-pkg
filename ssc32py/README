This package is designed to interact with the SSC-32 controller from Lynxmotion.
It has only been tested with V1 of the ATMega controller chip.

Special thanks to the kind folks at Healthcare Robotics Lab for creating the
excellent Robotis package. This package copies most of the code and organization
from the Robotis example. Therefore portions of the code are still copyrighted
by HRL, and all code is released under the same BSD license.

The SSC-32 controller can be purchased from Lynxmotion:

How to run the code:

You can run the default server with parameters for an AL5C arm using the 
sample .launch file:

roslaunch ssc32py sample_server.launch dev_name:=/dev/ttyUSB1

Take a look at launch/al5c.yaml to see how to configure each named servo.

There is a sample client that moves between a few positions in 
launch/sample_client.py. This sample just connects to named servos and
moves them to desired angles.
